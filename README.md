## Usage

### Google Drive

#### Create a Google Cloud project

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Click the project selector at the top of the page.
- Click **New Project**.
- In the **Project name** field, enter a name for the project, such as "NextDrive-toolkit".
- Click **Create**.
- Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.
- Click **Open**.
- In the **Google Cloud console**, on the project selector page, select your project.

#### Enable the API

Before using Google Drive APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project. You can turn on one or more APIs in a single Google Cloud project.

- In the Google Cloud console, enable the [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive.googleapis.com).

#### Configure the OAuth consent screen

If you're using a new Google Cloud project to complete this quickstart, configure the OAuth consent screen and add yourself as a test user. If you've already completed this step for your Cloud project, skip to the next section.

- Go to the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) page in the Google Cloud console.
- Select **External** and click **Create**.
- Enter a name for your application, such as "NextDrive-toolkit", and click **Save**.
- In the **Scopes** section, click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
- In the **Select OAuth Scopes** dialog, select the following scopes and click **Update**:

  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`

- In the **Test users** section, click **Add Users** and add your Google account as a test user.
- Click **Save**.

#### Authorize credentials for a web application

To authenticate as an end user and access user data in your app, you need to create one or more OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. A client ID is used to identify a single app to Google's OAuth servers. If your app runs on multiple platforms, you must create a separate client ID for each platform.

- Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page in the Google Cloud console.
- Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
- Select **Web application** and click **Create**.
- Enter a name for your OAuth 2.0 client ID, such as "NextDrive-toolkit", and click **Create**.
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use in the next section.
- Click **OK**.
- Click the **Download JSON** button to the right of the client ID.

#### Configure the Toolkit

To configure the toolkit, rename the downloaded JSON file to `credentials.json` and place it in the `NextDrive-toolkit` folder.
